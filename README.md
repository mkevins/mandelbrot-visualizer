# Mandelbrot Visualization

[This is an HTML5 visualization of the Mandelbrot set](https://matthewkevins.com/mandelbrot-visualizer/). Initial iteration coordinates are selected based on mouse coordinates, and plot color of each initial input changes over time.

## Controls

### Mouse:

* Move mouse around to begin iterating
* Scroll up to zoom in
* Scroll down to zoom out

_Tip_: Turn off overlay while zooming for better performance.

### Keys:
| Key | Result    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| c       | Toggle color cycling      |
| f       | Toggle fading     |
| o       | Toggle traditional overlay (grayscale)     |
| p       | Toggle pause (stops iterating with mouse movements)    |
| r       | Reset (clears the canvas)     |
| s       | Toggle symmetry     |
| [Space]       | Iterate at current mouse coordinates (works whie paused)     |
